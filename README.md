In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop an *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app on a topic of foodies safeguard using NYC crime data released on the [The Official Website of the City of New York
NYC](https://www1.nyc.gov) and [NYC Open Data] website (https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us). See [Project 2 Description](doc/project2_desc.md) for more details.  

The **Main Goals** for this project is:

- Design and Develop Shiny App/Shiny Server to facilitate users with decision making
- Using Data Science techniques to find business intelligence from data
- Data Merging, Processing and Visualization using Animated Plot, Interactive Geograph
- Design Product to improve user experience and efficiency


+ **Contribution Statement**:

Mengqi Chen: Processed yelp data and crime data. Transfer numeric data into geometric data. Apply the package "leaflet" into the server and ui system. Connect the google API and wrote the neighborhood crime layer. Combined individual parts together and debugged. Improved the server and ui system. Organized the github and completed the readme files. Responsible for presentation. 

Shiqing Long: Cleaned Crime data, Exploratory Data Analysis using package "Plotly", plotted time series plot with range slider and selector buttons, animated scatter plot with mulitple trace, interactive heatmap and animated barchart and summurized business insights. Merged, processed restaurant data to compute the number of crimes around a given restaurants. Added pictures to modify project. Wrote github readme file.

Anke Xu: Constructed the framework of the shinyapp, including the basic ui and server system. Enabled the yelp data, crime data and police station data reactive. Design the ui part, choosing the colors, font styles and the layout. Debugged and improved the shinyapp. Provided ideas to the storytelling and discovered the business insights of the NYC map and each figure.  
Sen Fu: Wrote the police station layer, including data collecting, data processing, points plotting and label adding. Design the algorithm of how to calculate the crime in half a mile circle of each restaurant. Beautify the ui system, such as changing the font styles and colors using CSS and R.
